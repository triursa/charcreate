# Project Summary


## Overarching Idea
Charcreate is a module that will allow users to create their own TTRPG characters intelligently. The way that Charcreate will differ from other charactermancers and character creators is the intelligence of creating characters with speed. For example, a Tiefling has Darkvision, but a Twilight Cleric may have an enhanced darkvision due to their class. Instead of having two features showing on the character sheet, the Charcreate will be able to tell that two different features are effecting the darkvision value and instead combine them into an enhanced version of the darkvision and notate the interaction that caused them to combine.

Each character should have an audit trail that allows people to understand the interactions that gives them their core stats.

## MVP
In the past, we're trying to do too much all at once. I'd like to have two working Backgrounds, two working races, and the fighter class built out with dice roller mechanics to build out a character.
