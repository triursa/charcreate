# Character Builder Constitution

## Core Principles

### Simplicity
Every feature, interface, and workflow MUST be as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity in code, UI, and user experience. Rationale: Simplicity enables maintainability, onboarding, and reliability.

### Sleekness
Designs, interfaces, and outputs MUST be visually and functionally sleek. Prioritize clean layouts, modern aesthetics, and intuitive navigation. Rationale: Sleekness improves user satisfaction and project reputation.

### Responsiveness
All components and workflows MUST be responsive to user input and device constraints. The application MUST deliver fast feedback and adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and environments. Rationale: Responsiveness ensures accessibility and usability for all users.

## Additional Constraints
- Technology stack: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- Code MUST be type-safe and linted before merge
- All user-facing features MUST be accessible (WCAG AA minimum)
- Data persistence MUST use secure, reliable storage

## Development Workflow
- All code changes MUST be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- Automated tests MUST cover all core logic and UI components
- CI/CD pipeline MUST verify build, lint, and test status before deployment
- Major UI/UX changes require user feedback or approval


## Governance
The constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval by two maintainers, and a migration plan if breaking changes are introduced. All PRs and reviews MUST verify compliance with the constitution. Complexity must be justified in writing. Use README.md for runtime development guidance.
